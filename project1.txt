/*Project1.cpp

This is a program that creates an RPG called "Head of State" where you are the ruler of a country. Your actions determine what kind of ruler you will be. Is it a ruthless dictator, an aloof monarch, a benevolent president? Make your choices wisely, because the well being of your people, and of your head, depend on it.
