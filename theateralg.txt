The gross profit will be the number of adult tickets sold multiplied by the price of an adult ticket ($9) plus the number of child tickets sold multiplied by the price of a child ticket ($6)

Calculate net profit
The net profit will be the gross profit multiplied by 25% to calculate the theater's cut
